## music-channel-simulator

A program that simulates the operation of a music channel.

## Notes
In this work I used many built-in language tools, including  delegates, lambda expressions, events and LINQ.  
This was the final work in the University course "Programming in C#", which gave me a good experience of programming in this language.

It is not localized, but here is the description of the program in Russian.
I'll add a description in English if someone needs it.
